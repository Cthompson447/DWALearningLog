    <ul id="list">
        <li>Practical 1 involved the setup of a learning log website. The purpose of this is to show progress of each
            practical along with relevant learning outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>I started by setting up a basic page with hyperlinks to each practical and learning outcomes. Following from
            this, I spent some time thinking about how to implement
            css in a clean easy-to-use way for accessing each week's practical and outcomes. I decided that a tile
            system with hyperlinks would be nice for this. Each practical will have a
            small logo along with a link to each practical and learning outcomes page.
        </li>
        <li>Upon implementing this design I then ran my site through the
            <a id="inline-link" href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">css validator</a>.
            In order to do this I have hosted my site on GitHub Pages which then allowed me to link it into the
            validator. See below:
            <img src="media/cssValidator.png" width="752" height="253">
            <br/>
            The validator passed
            on first run without any amendments required which was great!
        </li>
        <li>In this practical I learned a lot about css, I made HTML containers and then assigned css classes to them
            with appropriate styling to arrange them nicely. There was a lot of trial and error to get the appearance
            how I liked it, this familiarised me with css properties like padding, margin and display as each of these
            was required to get the layout right.
        </li>
        <li>To develop this, I made use of <a id="inline-link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">JetBrains
            Webstorm</a> to
            develop this. My reason for choosing WebStorm was familiarity with Jetbrains IDEs, I use IntelliJ Idea for
            Java and TypeScript development in work extensively.
