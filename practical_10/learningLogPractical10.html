    <ul class="list">
        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical10_T1.html">Practical 10</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Task 1</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Parts i and ii were very straightforward, I just added a new images folder and downloaded
                some images from google. There are references to these images in the comments in the html file for
                <a class="inline-link" href="practical10_T1.html"></a>.</li>
                <li>Part iii was fairly simple, I just added an img tag, referenced an image I created and then
                wrapped it in an anchor tag to direct back to index.html.</li>
                <li>Part iv was also fairly simple, I added onMouseOver and onMouseOut events to the image and
                tied them in with my javascript to update the image depending if it's being hovered over or not.</li>
                <li>Part v was similar to part iii, I just used a different image and pointed the href to an
                external relevant site, being Toyota cars I directed it to Toyota.co.uk</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <li>Task 2 & 3</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Task 2 proved to be a bit trickier than task 1, I did some research and came across some examples
                on W3 schools for how to implement this. The slideshow works by running document.getElementsByClassName
                on the images which all have the same class to be part of the slideshow. Once we get the HTMl
                collection of these images, we set all display style properties to none. One image has it's style
                display property assigned to block. The script then continues to run but with an index change
                of +1 on the images in the collection. This allows it to loop through continuously displaying the next
                image each time.</li>
                <li>I implemented Task 3 while working on 2, it was a small code change to add a timeout to the function
                to force it to update every 3 seconds. When I tested this on the site it looked good, all 5 images loop
                indefinitely when on the webpage. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>Learning Outcomes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This practical was great learning experience, my main learning experience for this came from Tasks 2
            and 3. It was enjoyable to research the problem and then get a working solution. This was my first time
            gathering images into a collection to perform operations on them and it was very satisfying to see it
            working.</li>
            <li>I also familiarised myself with the onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers, something with
            which I had no prior experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
