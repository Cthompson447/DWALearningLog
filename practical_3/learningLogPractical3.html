    <ul class="list">
        <li>Task 1:
            <p>Task 1 requires description of some JavaScript statements</p>
            <ol>
                <li> var myAge =45; - creating a new variable "myAge" and setting its value to 45.</li>
                <li> myAge += 4; - value of myAge + 4. Value of myAge = 49</li>
                <li> myAge ++; - increase value of myAge by 1. Value of myAge = 50</li>
                <li> myAge == 40+10; - comparison to check if myAge is equal to 50. Value of myAge=50 therefore this is
                    true
                </li>
                <li> myAge <=38; - comparison to check if myAge is less than or equal to 38. Value of myAge=50 therefore
                    this is false
                </li>
                <li> myAge =40; - assigning myAge to value of 40.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical3.html">Task 2:</a>
            <p>The value of myAge after the statement 'myAge = "My age is" + " " + myAge' is the concatenated string
                value
                of "My age is" + " " + the integer value of myAge. The value of this is "My age is 49".</p>
            <ol>
                <li> myAge ++; - after adding this "My age is 50" is displayed - as expected</li>
                <li> myAge == 40+10; -after adding this "My age is 50" is still displayed - as expected. I added a line
                    'console.log(myAge == 40+10);' to check the comparison and checked my dev console which displayed
                    true
                    - as expected.
                </li>
                <li> myAge <=38; - after adding this "My age is 50" is displayed - as expected. I did the same as above
                    and added 'console.log(myAge <= 38);' which returned false in console - as expected
                </li>
                <li> myAge =40; - after adding this "My age is 40" is displayed - as expected.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical3.html">Task 3:</a>
            <p>The value of the variable myTextContainer is "A web browser will follow your instructions exactly and
                without an argument." which is the result of concatenation in the js += statements</p>
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical3Task4.html">Task 4:</a>
        <p>Task 4 involves finding and explaining 6 errors in the given in the practical document.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening script tag wasn't closed before javascript code - it would mean the
                javascript would be treated as tag attributes and would do nothing.</li>
                <li>'var 1function="learning" ;' has 2 problems, you cannot start a variable with a number
                and function is a reserved keyword and cannot be used for variable assignment.</li>
                <li>'var course' is not referenced because of a spelling mistake in
                'document.write("I am " + learning +" "+ corse + " for "+ year +" years,"+ type);' </li>
                <li>bgcolour does not work because the style attribute uses the american spelling 'color'</li>
                <li>'var type="full time"' and ' year +=2' don't have semicolons at end of line, not best practice</li>
                <li>'text' is a deprecated attribute, 'color' should be used instead for text</li>
                <li>'var course=imd/ict;' is incorrect - you cannot divide a string by a string. Assuming this
                is imd or ict, this variable should be in quotes e.g. var course="imd/ict".</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <li>Learning Outcomes:
            <ol>
                <li>I familiarised myself with Javascript operators in tasks 1, 2 and 3. I made sure I understood
                all operators as well as comparisons by using console.log(); so that I could test outputs in
                chrome dev console.</li>
                <li>In Task 4 I improved my troubleshooting skills through some trial and error with the provided
                html script. From some previous experience in work - I was able to highlight 6 problems and
                some improvements for the script. The links are as follows for the practicals
                    <a class="inline-link" href="practical3.html">Tasks 1,2,3</a> and
                    <a class="inline-link" href="practical3Task4.html">Task 4</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
