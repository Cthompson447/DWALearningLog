    <p class="list-header">Tasks & Learning Outcomes:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Task 1</li>
        <ul>
            In Task 1 I was required to create 3 arrays storing university names, course names and campus names.
            Once I had created the 3 arrays I then used window.document.write and built up the message with strings
            and array indexes. This refreshed me on working with arrays. Task 1 can be viewed
            <a class="inline-link" href="practical4_t1.html">here</a>.
        </ul>

        <br/>
        <li>Task 2</li>
        <ul>Task 2 involved a few different steps - I'll outline these in 3 points and link them similarly to above</ul>
        <br/>
        <ol>
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical4_t1b.html">Task 2 Part 1</a> involved writing a javascript
            function that would write a piece of text to the web page. I wrote a function DisplayText() that accepts
            a string parameter and will print it on the webpage.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical4_t1c.html">Task 2 Part 2</a> involved carrying out the same
            function as above but abstracting the javascript into its own file. This was simple to implement as
            it involved creating a new file and then referencing the file in the script tags. The script is ran
            on page load and works as expected.</li>
            <br/>
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical4_t1d.html">Task 2 Part 3</a> involved altering the above html
            file to accept a user's name in text input along with a button to grab the value and output it on the
            browser screen. I set this up as an alert which can be seen in the link above. <br/><br/>
            The next section of this task was to add 3 drop down lists to allow the user to select values from
            I setup a new JS file for this, with the 3 arrays and wrote a function with a for loop to populate these
            dynamically. I then wrote a function that returns a formatted message along with the values from the
            dropdown lists.</li>
            <br/>
        </ol>
        <br/><br/>
        <li>
            My main learning outcomes from this practical was becoming familiar with writing javascript from scratch,
            previously I was used to using libraries or pre-made functions so this practical has helped me understand
            the fundamental building blocks of JS in a webapp. I also got the hang of writing basic functions and logic
            through populating my drop down lists with functions I had written myself.
        </li>
