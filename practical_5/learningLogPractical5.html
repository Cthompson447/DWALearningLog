    <ul id="list">
        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical5Task1.html">Task 1</a> involved writing a for loop to count down
            from a number set by a user in an input box. This was a simple matter of calling a js function with the
            result of a document.getElementById for the textbox. Upon clicking the button, the user will then be
            displayed a descending list counting down from what they entered.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical5Task2.html">Task 2</a> involved similar logic to task 1 but more
            complicated. I approached this task by adding IDs to DOM elements, then using js to append checkboxes
            and radio buttons to those elements. To populate the information of the radio buttons/checkboxes, I
            referenced array indexes to populate attributes and text. An example of this is
            universityOfUlsterCampus[i].valueOf().
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>For me, the main learning outcome of this practical was manipulating DOM elements with JS, it's a concept
        that I'm used to having a framework such as Angular doing for me. It's been beneficial to see how this
        works by interfacing with it directly through organic JavaScript</li>
