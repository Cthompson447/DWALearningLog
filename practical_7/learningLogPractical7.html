    <ul class="list">
        <li>Task 1</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The HTML example will create a basic unstyled HTML page with a multiplication table. An empty
            table is created by html with styling border=3 and cellpadding=6. The nested for loops will then generate
            the table contents. The first for loop simply creates a table row element. The Second for loop nested
            within the first will then create 5 cells per row with different multiplication values. (1*j), (2*j),
            (3*j), (4*j), (5*j). Once 5 cells have been created the TR element is closed and a new line taken by
            the first loop.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Task2</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical7_T2and3.html">Task 2 and 3 </a></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>Learning outcomes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Task 1 was simply explaining some counter controlled table elements, this was a concept which I was
            already familiar with</li>
            <li>Tasks 2 I created a table and populated it with dom elements for the
            insurance form. I then wrote a function calculateInsuranceClassification() that will calculate the
            insurance classification for the user.</li>
            <li>Task 3 was entirely new to me and proved to be a challenge, I decided that for first name and
            surname, regular expressions would be the way to go to validate these. I wrote a new funtion called
                validateInputs() that checks if first name and surname match regular expression of only upper and
            lowercase letters. If they do not match I focus the element and return false. For age I ensured it
                was a number and not lower than 17. <br/>
                I added onclick="if(validateInputs()){getClassification()} to the button to ensure that a
            classification would only be calculated if validation rules were passed.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>This practical was really helpful as it familiarised me with writing my own validation, something
            that I've not tried before.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
