            <li><a class="inline-link" href="practical9_T1.html">Task 1</a></li>
            <li>Task 1 part i involved replicating a screenshot of a quiz screen, I carried this out by using
            js to generate the dom structure for me along with required attributes.</li>
            <li>Task 1 part ii required a function to be added into the js library for this practical. I added this
            in and had to do some debugging to get it working correctly with the selectedIndex in drop down lists.</li>
            <li>Part iii was simply importing the script to the html doc</li>
            <li>For part iv, I created an array with values non-formatted for display, originally my asserts were
            not working to calculate score but this was down to the difference in displaying symbols on chrome vs
            using them for comparison in an array</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Before this practical, I was unaware of XHTML, I've learned that it's very similar to HTML except
            with stricter markup rules. There are a lot of formatting rules that are strictly enforced by the
            XHTML standard.</li>
            <li>I also had not realised that less than and greater than symbols require modifiers to be output on
            the front-end correctly. I also learned that this doesn't apply for variables set that are not displayed,
            it took some debugging for me to work out why my correct answers weren't correct.</li>
